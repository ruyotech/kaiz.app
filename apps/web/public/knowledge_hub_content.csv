Agile is the methodology that companies like Apple, Google, Spotify, and Amazon use to ship world-class products every week.

### Core Principles:
- **Work in short, focused cycles** (Sprints)
- **Commit only to what you can deliver**
- **Measure everything**
- **Improve continuously**
- **Adapt quickly when things change**

### Why Agile for Life?

Your life is the most important product you'll ever build. Traditional approaches fail because endless to-do lists never end, vague annual goals fade by February, and reactive firefighting replaces proactive planning.

### Annual Goals Approach:
- Set big goals in January
- Forget them by March
- Feel guilty in December
- Repeat

### The Agile Alternative:
Instead of planning a year ahead, plan one week at a time with continuous feedback and adaptation.

### In Kaiz:
- **Duration**: 1 week (Sunday to Saturday)
- **Start**: Sprint Planning (Sunday)
- **Daily**: Quick standups
- **End**: Review & Retrospective

### Key Principles:
