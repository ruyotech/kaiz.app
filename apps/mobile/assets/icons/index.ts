/**
 * Custom Icon Assets Index
 *
 * When custom icons are added to assets/icons/, export them here.
 * Example:
 *
 *   export { default as IconTask } from './task.svg';
 *   export { default as IconChallenge } from './challenge.svg';
 *
 * Until custom icons are added, all icons are served through
 * @expo/vector-icons via constants/icons.ts + components/ui/AppIcon.tsx.

// Placeholder — custom icon exports will be added here
