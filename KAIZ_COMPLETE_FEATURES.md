# The Agile Life System

## What is Agile?

Agile is the methodology that transformed how the world's best companies build products. Companies like Apple, Google, Spotify, and Amazon use Agile to ship world-class software every single week.

**The core principles:**
- Work in short, focused cycles (Sprints)
- Commit only to what you can actually deliver
- Measure everything
- Improve continuously
- Adapt quickly when things change

## Why Agile for Life?

Your life is the most important product you'll ever build. Yet most people "manage" it with:
- Endless to-do lists that never end
- Vague annual goals that fade by February
- Reactive firefighting instead of proactive planning
- No measurement of actual progress
- No systematic improvement

**Kaiz brings Agile to personal life:**

| Agile Concept | In Software | In Kaiz (Your Life) |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Sprint** | 2-week development cycle | 1-week life cycle |
| **Backlog** | Features to build | Goals & tasks to accomplish |
| **Story Points** | Effort estimation | Task complexity (1-21 scale) |
| **Velocity** | Team capacity | Your personal capacity |
| **Standup** | Daily team sync | Daily personal check-in |
| **Retrospective** | What went well/wrong | Weekly reflection |
| **Epic** | Large feature | Major life goal |
| **Product Owner** | Decides priorities | You |
| **Scrum Master** | Coaches the team | SensAI (your AI coach) |

## The Weekly Sprint Cycle

Every week in Kaiz follows a proven rhythm:

### Sunday: Sprint Planning
- Review your backlog
- Select tasks for the week
- Commit within your velocity
- Set your sprint goal

### Monday-Friday: Daily Execution
- Morning standup (2 minutes)
- Focus on committed tasks
- Track progress in real-time
- Handle blockers immediately

### Saturday: Sprint Review
- What did you ship?
- What's your completion rate?
- Celebrate wins

### Sunday: Retrospective
- What went well?
- What didn't?
- One improvement for next sprint

**This cycle repeats 52 times per year.** 52 opportunities to improve. 52 chances to ship your life.

# Sprint Calendar & Planning

## The Calendar View

Your sprint calendar is command central. Everything happens here.

### Week View
See all 7 days at a glance:
- Each day shows scheduled tasks
- Color-coded by Life Wheel area
- Story points visible on each task
- Progress indicators (To Do / In Progress / Done)
- Sprint name at the top (e.g., "S05-Feb-2026")

### Day View
24-hour timeline like Outlook or Google Calendar:
- Hour-by-hour schedule
- Tasks time-blocked to specific slots
- Synced events from Google/Apple Calendar
- Visual density indicator
- Tap any slot to add a task

### Month Picker
Quick navigation:
- Tap sprint name to expand month view
- See full month calendar
- Jump to any week instantly
- Past sprints show completion stats
- Future sprints show planned capacity

## Sprint Navigation

**Swipe gestures:**
- Swipe left → Next week
- Swipe right → Previous week

**Sprint selector:**
- Past sprints (completed, read-only stats)
- Current sprint (active, editable)
- Future sprints (planning mode)

## Task Grouping Views

### Eisenhower Matrix View
The proven prioritization framework built in:

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Important** | **Q1: DO FIRST** 🔥 Crisis, deadlines, emergencies | **Q2: SCHEDULE** 🎯 Growth, strategy, prevention |
| **Not Important** | **Q3: DELEGATE** ⚡ Interruptions, some meetings | **Q4: ELIMINATE** 🗑️ Time wasters, busy work |

Each quadrant is collapsible. See total points and task count per quadrant.

**The Q2 Focus:** Kaiz specifically tracks your Q2 (Important but Not Urgent) because this is where life-changing work happens—but it's the most neglected quadrant.

### Status View
Group by progress:
- **To Do** — Not started
- **In Progress** — Currently working
- **Done** — Completed

### Size View
Group by effort:
- **Small** (1-3 points) — Quick wins
- **Medium** (5-8 points) — Standard tasks
- **Large** (13-21 points) — Major efforts

## Sprint Metrics

Every sprint tracks:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Committed Points** | Total points you planned |
| **Completed Points** | Total points you finished |
| **Completion Rate** | Completed ÷ Committed × 100% |
| **Velocity** | Average completed points (last 4 sprints) |
| **Carryover** | Unfinished tasks from previous sprint |
| **Churn** | Tasks added mid-sprint (scope creep) |

**Velocity is your truth.** It tells you how much you can realistically accomplish in a week. Stop overcommitting. Start shipping.

# Task Management System

## Creating Tasks

Every task captures:

### Required Fields
- **Title** — Clear, actionable name
- **Story Points** — Effort estimate (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

### Optional Fields
- **Description** — Details, notes, context
- **Life Wheel Area** — Which life dimension (Health, Career, etc.)
- **Eisenhower Quadrant** — Priority classification
- **Epic** — Parent goal (if part of larger objective)
- **Sprint** — When to do it (current, next, or backlog)
- **Due Date** — Hard deadline
- **Attachments** — Files, images, documents
- **Checklist** — Subtasks within the task

## Story Points Explained

Story points measure **effort**, not time.

| Points | Meaning | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **1** | Trivial, < 15 min | Send an email, make a call |
| **2** | Quick, 15-30 min | Review a document, short workout |
| **3** | Small, 30-60 min | Write a report section, grocery shopping |
| **5** | Medium, 1-2 hours | Deep work session, family outing |
| **8** | Large, half day | Major project milestone, day trip |
| **13** | Very large, full day | Workshop, major home task |
| **21** | Massive, multi-day | Should probably be broken down |

**Pro tip:** If a task is 13+, consider breaking it into smaller tasks.

## Task Detail View

# Epics & Long-Term Goals

## What is an Epic?

An Epic is a large goal that spans multiple sprints. It's too big for one week, so it gets broken into smaller tasks.

**Examples of Epics:**
- "Learn Spanish" (3-month goal)
- "Renovate bathroom" (6-week project)
- "Get AWS certification" (2-month study plan)
- "Plan wedding" (year-long project)
- "Write a book" (6-month endeavor)
- "Launch side business" (ongoing)

## Epic Properties

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Title** | Epic name |
| **Description** | Full details and scope |
| **Color** | Visual identification |
| **Icon** | Quick recognition |
| **Life Wheel Area** | Which dimension |
| **Target Sprint** | When to complete |
| **Tasks** | Linked tasks that build the epic |

## Epic Progress Tracking

Each epic shows:
- **Total Points** — Sum of all task points
- **Completed Points** — Finished tasks
- **Progress Bar** — Visual completion %
- **Task Breakdown** — By status
- **Burndown** — Points remaining over time
- **Timeline** — Weeks to target

## Managing Epic Tasks

- Add existing tasks to epic
- Create new tasks within epic
- Remove tasks from epic
- View all epic tasks in one place
- Filter sprint view by epic

## Epic Templates

Pre-built epic templates for common goals:
- Fitness transformation

# Calendar Sync & Integration

## Why Calendar Sync Matters

Your time is finite. Your external calendar (work meetings, appointments, events) blocks real hours. Kaiz needs to see this to plan accurately.

**Without sync:** You commit 40 points but have 20 hours of meetings. You fail.

**With sync:** Kaiz sees your meetings, calculates available time, adjusts recommended capacity. You succeed.

## Supported Calendars

### Google Calendar
- Full two-way sync
- Multiple calendar support
- Event details imported
- Real-time updates
- Color coding preserved

### Apple Calendar (iCloud)
- Full two-way sync
- All iOS calendars
- Event details imported
- Push notifications
- Seamless on iPhone/iPad

### Outlook Calendar
- Read-only sync
- Work calendar support
- Meeting detection
- Time block recognition

## How Sync Works

### Reading External Events
Kaiz imports events from your connected calendars:
- Meeting title (or "Busy" for private)
- Start and end time
- Location (if available)
- All-day event flag

These appear on your Kaiz calendar as **blocked time**.

### Capacity Calculation

Kaiz automatically adjusts your capacity:

```
Base Weekly Hours: 40 hours
- Synced meetings: 15 hours
- Sleep (auto-blocked): 56 hours (8h × 7 days)
= Available Hours: 25 hours

Your velocity: 30 points
Capacity ratio: 25/40 = 62.5%
Adjusted capacity: 30 × 0.625 = ~19 points recommended
```

SensAI uses this to warn about overcommitment.

### Creating Events in Kaiz
When you create time-blocked tasks:
- Optionally sync to external calendar
- Appears in Google/Apple/Outlook
- Two-way: edit in either place
- Delete syncs too

## Calendar Views

### Day Schedule View
- 24-hour timeline
- External events shown in gray
- Kaiz tasks shown in color
- Available slots visible
- Tap to add task to time slot

### Week Overview
- All 7 days visible
- Event density indicator
- Busy days highlighted
- Help plan sprint capacity

## Setup Process

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Select calendar provider
3. Authenticate with Google/Apple/Microsoft
4. Choose calendars to sync
5. Set sync frequency
6. Done — events appear immediately

## Privacy

- Kaiz only reads event times and titles
- No access to email or contacts
- You control which calendars sync
- Revoke access anytime
- Data never sold or shared

## Interventions

SensAI proactively alerts you:

### Intervention Types

| Type | Icon | Urgency | When |
|------|------|---------|------|
| **Alert** | 🚨 | High | Immediate action needed |
| **Warning** | ⚠️ | Medium | Problem forming |
| **Nudge** | 💡 | Low | Suggestion/opportunity |
| **Celebration** | 🎉 | Positive | Achievement unlocked |

### Intervention Categories

**Capacity Interventions:**
- Overcommitment warning
- Undercommitment notice
- Velocity decline alert
- Burnout risk detection

**Balance Interventions:**
- Life wheel neglect (area at 0% for 2+ sprints)
- Q2 emptiness (no growth tasks)
- Single-dimension spike (all work, no play)

**Execution Interventions:**
- Sprint at risk (behind pace)
- Task blocked too long
- Churn warning (too many mid-sprint adds)
- Carryover trending up

**Example Interventions:**

> 🚨 **Overcommit Alert**
> You've committed 52 points. Your 4-sprint average is 28. That's 86% over your velocity.
> **Suggested action:** Remove 24 points or accept high failure risk.

> ⚠️ **Balance Warning**
> Your Health dimension has been 0% for 3 consecutive sprints.
> **Suggested action:** Add "30-min walk" (2 pts) to restore balance.

> 💡 **Q2 Nudge**
> You're spending 80% in Q1 (urgent). Your Q2 (important but not urgent) is empty.
> **Suggested action:** Block 2 hours for strategic work this week.

> 🎉 **Streak Celebration**
> You've hit 90%+ completion for 4 sprints in a row! Your system is working.

### Intervention Actions

For each intervention you can:
- **Acknowledge** — Accept and take action
- **Snooze** — Remind me later
- **Dismiss** — I understand the risk
- **Override** — Proceed anyway (logged)

## Velocity Tracking

SensAI tracks your velocity over time:

### Metrics Displayed

# Life Wheel Balance System

## The 9 Dimensions of Life

| # | Dimension | Icon | What It Covers |
|---|-----------|------|----------------|
| 1 | **Health & Fitness** | 💪 | Exercise, nutrition, sleep, medical |
| 2 | **Career & Work** | 💼 | Job, business, professional growth |
| 3 | **Finance & Money** | 💰 | Income, savings, investments, bills |
| 4 | **Personal Growth** | 🧠 | Learning, skills, self-improvement |
| 5 | **Relationships & Family** | ❤️ | Partner, kids, parents, close family |
| 6 | **Social Life** | 👥 | Friends, community, networking |
| 7 | **Fun & Recreation** | 🎨 | Hobbies, entertainment, play |
| 8 | **Environment & Home** | 🏠 | Living space, possessions, organization |
| 9 | **Spirit & Meaning** | 🙏 | Purpose, values, mindfulness, religion |

## Every Task Gets Tagged

When you create a task, you select its Life Wheel area. This enables:
- Balance tracking
- Dimension filtering
- Neglect detection
- Wheel visualization

## Life Wheel Chart

A radar chart showing your balance:
- 9 axes (one per dimension)
- Current sprint distribution (%)
- Historical average
- Ideal balance line

## Balance Score

Kaiz calculates a 0-100 balance score:
- **80-100:** Well balanced
- **50-79:** Moderate (some neglect)
- **0-49:** Needs attention (significant gaps)

## Neglect Detection

SensAI monitors for:
- Any dimension at 0% for 2+ sprints
- Single dimension > 50% (over-indexing)
- Growth areas (Q2) consistently empty
- Health dropping while Career spikes

## Recovery Tasks

When imbalance detected, SensAI suggests minimal recovery:

> "Your Social dimension has been 0% for 3 sprints. Suggested: 'Coffee with friend' (2 pts) — takes 1 hour, restores balance."

These are small, low-effort tasks designed to prevent complete neglect.

## Life Wheel in Onboarding

During onboarding, you rate each dimension 1-10:
- Identifies starting weak areas
- Personalizes initial task suggestions
- Creates baseline for improvement tracking
